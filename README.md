# WirelessSensorNetwork_CLD
This repository contains an outline and simulation of an original cross-layer design for a wireless sensor network, with the goal of maximising energy efficiency and increasing the lifetime of the network. An explanation of the design can be found in the document `Cross_Layer_WSN_design_report`, and a Google Colabatory simulation is contained in the file `Cross_Layer_WSN_design_simulation.ipynb`.
