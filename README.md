# WirelessSensorNetwork_CLD
This repository contains an outline and simulation of a cross-layer design for a wireless sensor network, with the goal of maximising energy efficiency and increasing the lifetime of the network. An explanation of the design can be found in the document `Cross_Layer_WSN_design_report`, and a Google Colabatory simulation is contained in the file `Cross_Layer_WSN_design_simulation.ipynb` (a visualisation of a 16-round simulation can be found at the bottom of this notebook, as well as a graph displaying the gains in transmission distance.)
